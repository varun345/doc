# Controlling DUTY supply v1

## Why DUTY has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of DUTY token, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

> DUTY's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. _Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity (LP fees etc. would remain)._

**So what are the other ways DUTY's supply is limited, to counter inflation?**

## How DUTY supply is reduced without a hard cap

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into DutySwap's products. The goal is for more DUTY to leave circulation than the amount of DUTY that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of DUTY made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.duty.exchange/#/duty/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of DUTY entering circulation from 40 DUTY per block to 14.5. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of DutySwap's products (like a 10% burn of DUTY spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way.
