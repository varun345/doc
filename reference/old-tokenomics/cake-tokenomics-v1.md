# DUTY Tokenomics v1

## **Emission rate** <a href="#emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                   | **Emission/block (DUTY)** | **Emission/day (DUTY)** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| Emission                                                                     |                        40 |               1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](duty-tokenomics-v1.md#why-is-the-duty-burn-manual) |                    -25.75 |                -787,600 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                       |              **<14.25\*** |           **364,400\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 DUTY per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of DUTY is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 DUTY are harvested, then 9.09 DUTY is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All DUTY minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="#distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to                | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total DUTY) |           Reward/day |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ------------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms and Lottery             |                       10.62% |                      4.25 |     122,400 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned  |                              |                           |              -46,000 |
| Syrup Pools                   |                          25% |                        10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily DUTY Emission** |                              |                           | **364,400 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="#other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, DUTY is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on DutySwap V2
* **100%** of DUTY sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of DUTY performance fees from IFOs
* **100%** of DUTY spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **100%** of DUTY bid during Farm Auctions
* **20%** of DUTY spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** DUTY per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The DUTY for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy DUTY for burning
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto DUTY Pool
* **2%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy DUTY for burning

## Why is the DUTY burn manual?

To hit the ground running, DutySwap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the MasterChef contract emitting 40 DUTY per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the DUTY minting logic. As migrating to a new MasterChef would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce DUTY emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating two pools:

* Legacy Lottery Pool (PID - 137) - burned DUTY from the lottery
* Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned DUTY per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Chefs can adjust the percentage of the 40 DUTY per block allocated to it after each DUTY emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million DUTY.&#x20;

Don't worry - **THIS DUTY NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the DUTY that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The DUTY sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending DUTY isn’t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm DUTY Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating DUTY supply shown on the DutySwap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the DUTY token contract on BscScan and [see how much DUTY is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of DUTY that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual DUTY supply.
