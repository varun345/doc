# Migrate Your Stakings

![ICYDK: you are currently reading the "tutorial" mentioned in this banner](<../../.gitbook/assets/migration pre heat.png>)

In order to keep earning staking rewards, you will need to migrate your farms and pools staking to the new MasterChef. Relax, it's gonna be easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**But wait! Do I need to migrate?**

You need to migrate if you are:

* Farming on DutySwap **Farms**.
* Staking in DutySwap **DUTY Syrup Pools** (Manual, Auto, IFO).

\*other Syrup Pools aren’t affected
{% endhint %}

## How to migrate?

![At the time of the migration, Chefs will deploy a step-by-step helper to walk you through the process ](../../.gitbook/assets/migration-helper-overview.png)

### 1. Navigate to the migration helper

Go to [https://duty.exchange/migration](https://duty.exchange/migration), and connect your wallet.

### 2. Unstake from the old farms

There are two steps in the migration helper. In the first step, you should see a list of three DUTY syrup pools and farms you are currently staking.

Click "**Unstake All**" on each of the farms and pools to unstake all your assets.

After unstaking, click "**Go to Stake**" to proceed to step 2.

### 3. Stake your LP tokens and DUTY into the new farms and pools.

Here you should see the brand new DUTY syrup pool and the new farms. Before staking, you will need to enable them.

Click "**Enable**" to enable staking on each of the farms and the DUTY syrup pool. If you are using a mobile device, please click the “**v**” (downward arrow) to expand the card while looking for the "**Enable**" button.

#### Why lock staking is not available?

SOON! To achieve a smooth migration. Lock (fixed-term) staking will be enabled a few days after the migrations.

#### I can't find my farms in the migration helper!

It might be due to the farm being discontinued before the migration. Please:
