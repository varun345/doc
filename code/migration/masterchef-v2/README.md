# MasterChef v2

DutySwap MasterChef v2 is a new main staking contract for Farms while providing more flexibility for adjusting the $DUTY emissions, including DUTY pool, burn and other DutySwap products.

### Do I need to migrate?

If you are currently using DutySwap MasterChef ([0x73feaa1eE314F8c655E354234017bE2193C9E24E](https://bscscan.com/address/0x73feaa1eE314F8c655E354234017bE2193C9E24E)), you will need to migrate to the new contract ([0xa5f8C5Dbd5F286960b9d90548680aE5ebFf07652](https://bscscan.com/address/0xa5f8C5Dbd5F286960b9d90548680aE5ebFf07652)).

### Overview

#### Deposit&#x20;

If you are currently using the `enterStaking(uint256 _amount)` on the current DutySwap MasterChef. You need to migrate to the new DUTY pool contract. Check out the related documentation [here](../duty-syrup-pool.md).

The deposit function for the farm pools is unchanged. However, you will need to upgrade the MasterChef address and the `pid` , check out the [list of farms](list-of-farms.md) for the list of new `pids` on MasterChef v2.

#### Pool types

MasterChef v2 have 2 types of pool: Regular farm pools and Special farm pools, which you can use `poolInfo(_pid).isRegular` to query the pool type. They share a different `totalAllocPoint`, making them two sets of independent pools.

Special farm pools: only whitelisted addresses can deposit. They are usually utilized by internal DutySwap products for rewards distributions.

Regular farm pools: the regular LP tokens farms. For example DUTY-BNB, BNB-BUSD, etc…

#### Withdraw

If you are currently using the `leaveStaking(uint256 _amount)` on the current DutySwap MasterChef. You need to migrate to the new DUTY pool contract. Check out the related documentation [here](../duty-syrup-pool.md).

The withdraw function for the farm pools is unchanged. However, you will need to update the MasterChef address and the `pid` , check out the [list of farms](list-of-farms.md) for the list of new `pids` on MasterChef v2.

#### Staking Balance

Use `userInfo[_pid][_user].amount` to query the staking balance.

#### Staking Token&#x20;

Note that the new `PoolInfo` struct **does not** contain the lp token address field, you will need to use `lpToken(_pid)` to query any given pool's staking token.&#x20;

#### Total Staking Shares/Amount

Use `lpToken.balanceOf(MasterChef.address)` to get the total staking amount for any given farm pool.

However, In MasterChef v2, the users' share can be boosted (coming soon). Therefore, rewards are calculated using a new `totalBoostedShare` field in `PoolInfo` as each pool’s total shares. For example, if pool 0 has 2 users, user1 stake 100 LPs (without boost), user2 stake 100 (with `boostMultiplier` being 1.05), then the `totalBoostedShare` will become 205. Resulting in user2 gaining more rewards.

#### DutyPerBlock

You can use `dutyPerBlock(bool _isRegular)` to query the DUTY reward per block that goes to all the DutySwap farms.
