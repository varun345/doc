# SYRUP \(Staking\)

**Stack your DUTY with syrup.**

* 25% of DUTY emissions will be distributed to SYRUP holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.
* DUTY holders can swap DUTY for SYRUP at a 1:1 ratio.
* DUTY is distributed proportionally at each block based on SYRUP holdings.
* We will only record and distribute DUTY rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. While Syrup can be sent to other addresses only the initiating address will receive the DUTY rewards,
