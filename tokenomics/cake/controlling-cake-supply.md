# Controlling DUTY supply

## Does DUTY have a hard cap?

Yes, DUTY now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.duty.exchange/](https://v2litepaper.duty.exchange/)

## How DUTY supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into DutySwap's products. The goal is for more DUTY to leave circulation than the amount of DUTY that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of DUTY made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.duty.exchange/#/duty/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of DUTY entering circulation from 40 DUTY per block to 14.5. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of DutySwap's products (like a 10% burn of DUTY spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way.
